Kia ora / Winba duru / Talofa / Hello,

I offer cultural tourism experiences sharing my [Māori/Aboriginal/Pasifika] heritage with visitors. My business focuses on [cultural storytelling/traditional arts/guided experiences/etc.].

I want to maintain the authenticity and cultural integrity of what we do, while making the business side easier to manage.

Please suggest:
1. One simple way to reduce my paperwork time using easy-to-learn technology
2. How I might gather and organize visitor feedback more efficiently
3. A respectful way to reach international visitors who would value our cultural experiences

Please keep your suggestions very simple, with step-by-step instructions, and focus on tools that are free or low-cost to start with.
